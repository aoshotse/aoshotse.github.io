I am an Assistant Professor of Organizations and Management at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University. Currently, I also serve as a scientific advisor at Instill Labs. In Spring 2023, I graduated with a PhD in Organizational Behavior from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. My research interests focus on cultural phenomena in social and market contexts, as well as career attainment within organizations. Methodologically, my work encompasses various techniques, including computational linguistics, experimental approaches, and traditional econometric methods.

During my time at the GSB, I was a member of the Computational Culture Lab, which aims to pioneer novel ways of unearthing and systematically measuring culture while modeling its evolution. Prior to my studies at Stanford, I obtained an M.S. in Quantitative Methods from the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education and worked as a research analyst in the Capital Markets function at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
