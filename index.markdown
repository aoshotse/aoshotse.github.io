I am a 6th-Year PhD Student in the Economics Department at Stanford University. I have interned in the past at Chegg and Microsoft Research.  Before graduate school, I worked as an RA at the New York Federal Reserve. I will be on the academic job market in the 2021-2022 school year. You can find my job market website [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~larmona/) 

My research interests lie in industrial organization, postsecondary education and college behavior, the economics of information, and how machine learning methods can be used to enhance existing economic models.
