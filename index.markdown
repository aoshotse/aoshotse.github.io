I’m an incoming Assistant Professor of Organizations and Management at the Goizueta Business School at Emory University, as of Fall 2023. I am also currently a scientific advisor at Instill Labs. In Spring 2023, I graduated with a PhD in Organizational Behavior from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. My research interests pertain to cultural phenomena in social and market contexts, as well as career attainment within organizations. Methodologically, my work spans various techniques from computational linguistics, to experimental approaches, to traditional econometric methods.

At the GSB I was a member of the Computational Culture Lab, which aims to pioneer novel ways to unearthing and systematically measuring culture and modeling its evolution. Prior to my time at Stanford, I received an M.S. in Quantitative Methods from the University of Pennsylvania’s Graduate School of Education and worked as a research analyst in the Capital Markets function at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
