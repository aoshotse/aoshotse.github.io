I am a 5th-Year PhD Student in the Economics Department at Stanford University. I will be on the academic job market in 2022. I have interned in the past at Chegg and Microsoft Research.  Before graduate school, I worked as an RA at the New York Federal Reserve.

My research interests lie in industrial organization, the economics of information, postsecondary education, and how machine learning methods can be used to enhance existing economic models.
